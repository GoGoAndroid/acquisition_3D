# Tools for 3D acquisitions in developpement

* **Rotate a servo and take photos for 3D reconstruction**
  
read conf.jon then rotates to angleMax (°) ,step(°) by step, with a delay (ms) from startAt (°).

No photo taken for now, just rotations.

**Usage** : node command

It requires the module *serialport* (so np install  before)
  
* **Acquire points from 4 photos**

mark points on a photo

read the points in order to create OFF file

convert OFF to STL
